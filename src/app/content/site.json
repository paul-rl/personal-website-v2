      "description": "What if the arena itself were your arsenal? Groundbreak is a roguelike tactics RPG where you sling elemental tiles to trigger reactions such as sandstorms and fireballs to escape a multi-floor dungeon. As part of a four-person team, I led combat design, building the tile-flinging mechanics, elemental reaction system, and enemy AI powered by A* pathfinding. The most rewarding part was playtesting with over ten players to balance the elements and create diverse, fun build paths. (RIP Sandstorm)",

By herding, distracting, trading aggro, and luring enemies, players uncover hidden paths and secrets woven into the world’s ecosystem. Working in a four-person cross-functional team, I designed six dungeons centered on player-enemy interaction and built a choose-your-own-adventure prototype to test puzzle flow and ecosystem design early in development.",

I expanded a 35k+ React/Redux codebase to add a “Because You Watched” recommendations rail and build new reusable UI components. It was a crash course in how React and Redux intertwine to handle complex states and the satisfaction that comes with making interfaces feel as good as they look. I also dipped my toes in DevOps work for the first time, setting up GitHub Actions to automate testing and keep the codebase stable.",

I built a sequence-aware recommender with a SASRec Transformer and learned the habits that actually move the needle: evaluating on a store-like slate, keeping histories chronological, and the power of careful masking. From there, the fun was in the tinkering: swapping signals, rerunning vectorized scorers, and seeing the ranking shifts. Turns out raw counts can be problematic, but it's nothing normalization can't solve.",
