      "description": "What if the arena itself were your arsenal? Groundbreak is a roguelike tactics RPG where you sling element-infused tiles to create reactions; sandstorms, smoke, fireballs and more will help you outsmart a multi-floor dungeon of creepy-crawlies. On a four person team, I led combat design and implementation: tile-flinging, the elemental reaction system, and enemy AI powered by A* pathfinding. My favorite part was iterating with 10+ playtesters, tuning each element so multiple viable build paths emerged, keeping every choice fun. (RIP Sandstorm)",

      "description": "What if NPCs were the puzzle pieces? Keystone is an open-world adventure where NPC behaviors intertwine. By herding, distracting, trading aggro, and luring enemies, players uncover hidden paths and secrets woven into the world’s ecosystem. Working in a four-person cross-fuctional team, I designed six different dungeons built around player-enemy interaction. This was my first experience prototyping and playtesting, creating a lightweight choose-your-own-adventure protoype to help test puzzle flow and ecosystem designs early in development.",

I expanded a 35k+ React/Redux codebase to add a “Because You Watched” recommendations rail and build new reusable UI components. It was a crash course in how React and Redux intertwine to handle complex states and the satisfaction that comes with making interfaces feel as good as they look. I also dipped my toes in DevOps work for the first time, setting up GitHub Actions to automate testing and keep the codebase stable.",
